 * Network timeouts.
 * Because of the way this client is written it doesn't need to constantly talk (keep-alive) to the server to make
 * sure it is there. We detect a buggy / overloaded server by the call timeout. The default values will be ok for
 * nearly all cases. If they aren't the pool has most likely overload issues. Low call timeout values are preferable -
 * long timeouts mean that we waste hashes on potentially stale jobs. Connection report will tell you how long the
 * server usually takes to process our calls.
 *
 * call_timeout - How long should we wait for a response from the server before we assume it is dead and drop the connection.
 * retry_time	- How long should we wait before another connection attempt.
 *                Both values are in seconds.
 * giveup_limit - Limit how many times we try to reconnect to the pool. Zero means no limit. Note that stak miners
 *                don't mine while the connection is lost, so your computer's power usage goes down to idle.

 * Output control.
 * Since most people are used to miners printing all the time, that's what we do by default too. This is suboptimal
 * really, since you cannot see errors under pages and pages of text and performance stats. Given that we have internal
 * performance monitors, there is very little reason to spew out pages of text instead of concise reports.
 * Press 'h' (hashrate), 'r' (results) or 'c' (connection) to print reports.

 *                 3  - All of level 1, and new job (block) event in all cases, result submission event.

/*
 * LARGE PAGE SUPPORT
 * Large pages need a properly set up OS. It can be difficult if you are not used to systems administration,
 * but the performance results are worth the trouble - you will get around 20% boost. Slow memory mode is
 * meant as a backup, you won't get stellar results there. If you are running into trouble, especially
 * on Windows, please read the common issues in the README and FAQ.
 *
 * On Linux you will need to configure large page support and increase your memlock limit (ulimit -l).
 *
 * To set large page support, add the following to "/etc/sysctl.d/60-hugepages.conf":
 *     vm.nr_hugepages=128
 * You WILL need to run "sudo sysctl --system" for these settings to take effect on your system (or reboot).
 *  In some cases (many threads, very large CPU, etc) you may need more than 128
 *   (try 256 if there are still complaints from thread inits)
 *
 * To increase the memlock (ulimit -l), add following lines to /etc/security/limits.d/60-memlock.conf:
 *     *    - memlock 262144
 *     root - memlock 262144
 * You WILL need to log out and log back in for these settings to take effect on your user (no need to reboot, just relogin in your session).
 *
 * Check with "/sbin/sysctl vm.nr_hugepages ; ulimit -l" to validate
 *
 * Memory locking means that the kernel can't swap out the page to disk - something that is unlikely to happen on a
 * command line system that isn't starved of memory. I haven't observed any difference on a CLI Linux system between
 * locked and unlocked memory. If that is your setup see option "no_mlck".
 *
 *
 * use_slow_memory defines our behaviour with regards to large pages. There are three possible options here:
 * always  - Don't even try to use large pages. Always use slow memory.
 * warn    - We will try to use large pages, but fall back to slow memory if that fails.
 * no_mlck - This option is only relevant on Linux, where we can use large pages without locking memory.
 *           It will never use slow memory, but it won't attempt to mlock
 * never   - If we fail to allocate large pages we will print an error and exit.
